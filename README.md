# Charlotte's Tech Test

Kia Ora and welcome to my application. I have created a NextJS app using TS that displays the data specified in the requirements. When you open the app you wll be taken to home page. From there you can navigate via either using the header links or buttons on the page to see the data.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Assumptions

- I made the assumption that this test was more focused on the data manipulation aspect of things than the UI. Therefore I did not factor responsiveness into my application. I also did not implement any search functionality or pagination which in a real case scenario would be required.
